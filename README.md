REQUIREMENTS
------------

The minimum requirement by this project template that your Web server supports PHP 5.4.0.


INSTALLATION
------------

No need to worry about installation, just clone this repo. All dependencies should be downloaded too.

CONFIGURATION
-------------

### Database

Import file `pretest_privy.sql` to create database scheme including some data seed

**NOTES:**
- This file contains `CREATE DATABASE` command, so you don't need to create blank database
- Please do check `runtime` and `web` directory, it should be writable

### REST Client

Import file `Pretest-Privy.postman_collection.json` for API Collection & `Pretest-Privy.postman_environment.json` for the environment. You can import those file using Postman or Insomnia.

### Running Application

Simply run this command from your console `php yii server --port=7878`, so you can access it by calling `http://localhost:7878`.
You can change the port, but you have to change the REST Client environment settings too.
